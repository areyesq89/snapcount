\title{Shared Sample Count (SSC): counts total number of samples in which 2
different junctions both occur in.}
\usage{
shared_sample_counts(..., group_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more lists of SnaptronQueryBuilder objects}

\item{group_names}{Optional vector of character strings
representing group names}
}
\value{
A DataFrame of results based on the list of groups passed
in via "group_names".  Each group is reported with the # of
unique samples which occurred in all of its defined set of
related basic queries (e.g. two inclusion basic queries in a
cassette exon scenario).
}
\description{
This produces a list of user-specified groups and the read coverage
of the junctions in all the samples which were shared across all
the basic queries occurring in each group.
}
\details{
Example: User defines a single group of junctions "GroupA" made up of 2
separate regions (two basic queries).

An SSC query will return a single line for GroupA which will have
the total number of samples which had at least one junction which
was returned from both basic queries. It will also report a summary
statistic of the total number of groups which had one or more
samples that were shared across the basic queries, in this case it
would be 1.  Also, it will report the number of groups which had at
least one shared sample and which had matching junctions (from the
query) which were fully annotated.

This function can be used to determine how much cross-sample
support there is for a particular junction configuration (typically
a cassette exon).
