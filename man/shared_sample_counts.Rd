\title{Shared Sample Count (SSC): counts total number of samples in which 2
different junctions both occur in.}
\usage{
shared_sample_counts(..., group_names = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more lists of SnaptronQueryBuilder objects}

\item{group_names}{Optional vector of character strings representing group names}
}
\description{
This produces a list of user-specified groups and the read coverage of the
junctions in all the samples which were shared across all the basic queries
occurring in each group.
}
\details{
Example: User defines a single group of junctions "GroupA" made up of 2
separate regions (so 2 basic queries).

An SSC query will return a single line for GroupA which will have the total
number of samples which had at least one junction which matched both basic
queries. It will also report a summary statistic of the total number of
groups which had one or more samples that were shared across the basic
queries, in this case it would be 1.  Also, it will report the number of
groups which had at least one shared sample and which had matching
junctions (from the query) which were fully annotated*.
This function can be used to determine how much cross-sample support there
is for a particular junction configuration (typically a cassette exon).
