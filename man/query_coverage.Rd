\usage{
query_coverage(compilation, regions, group_names = NULL, sids = NULL,
  bulk = FALSE, split_by_region = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{compilation}{A single string containing the name of the Snaptron datasource}

\item{regions}{Either a list of 1 or more \code{HUGO} gene names \code{(e.g. "BRCA1")} or a
GRanges-class object containing one or more genomic intervals \code{(e.g. "chr1:1-1000")}.
Strand information is ignored.}

\item{group_names}{A list of one or more labels of the same length as the list of
\code{regions}. These labels serve as demarcation sentinels for the output
list of the bases since any one query will split over many output records \code{(typically)}.
Not required, but highly recommended.}

\item{sids}{A list of rail_ids (integer sample IDs) to filter results on. Only
records which have been found in at least one of these samples will be returned.}

\item{bulk}{Use the \code{Snaptron} bulk query interface. This will perform better when
running many queries at once. There is a limit of 50 queries per unit. More than 50
queries can be submitted but they will be broken up into units of 50.}

\item{split_by_region}{By default the results from multiple queries will be returned
in \code{RangedSummarizedExperiment} object with a \code{rowData} entry for each labeling each
result row according to the query it resulted from. However, if this is set to \code{TRUE},
the result will be a list of RangedSummarizedExperiment objects, one per original
interval/gene. This latter option may be useful but reqires metadata for each original
interval/gene.}

\description{
This is the basic coverage query function.  Given one or more
gene names or genomic range intervals it will return a list of 1
or more bases (in 1-base pair intervals) with their list of coverage
counts across all samples \code{(default)} or a sub-selection of sample
columns.  This form doesnâ€™t support any filters (except sample IDs \code{sids}) or modifiers.
NOTE: coordinates in this query form always half-open intervals, so their left
coordinate starts at 0 while the right coordinate starts at 1.
