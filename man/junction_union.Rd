\title{Get the union of junctions from 2 or more compilations
which are on the same reference}
\usage{
junction_union(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more SnaptronQueryBuilder objects}
}
\value{
A RangedSummarizedExperiment of junctions appearing in at least
one compilation
}
\description{
This function queries 2 or more compilations which are on the same
reference version (e.g. hg38) and merges the resulting junctions
into a single output table, unioning the sample coverage columns
and the snaptron_id (jx ID) columns (the latter delimiter will
be ":").  All sample IDs will be disjoint between compilations.
}
\details{
Union is based on the following fields (combined into a comparison key):
\preformatted{
     * group
     * chromosome
     * start
     * end
     * strand
}

The goal is to have a single list of junctions where every junction
occurs in at least one compilation and if a junction occurs in > 1
compilations it still only has a single row representing all the
samples across compilations that it appears in.
Sample aggregate statistics will be recalculated for junctions which
are merged across \emph{all} samples from all compilations:
\itemize{
\item sample_count
\item coverage_sum
\item coverage_avg
\item coverage_median
}
}
\examples{
sb1 <- SnaptronQueryBuilder$new()
sb1$compilation(Compilation$gtex)
sb1$regions("chr1:1879786-1879786")
sb1$coordinate_modifier(Coordinates$EndIsExactOrWithin)
sb1$range_filters(strand == "-")

sb2 <- SnaptronQueryBuilder$new()
sb2$compilation("tcga")
sb2$regions("chr1:1879786-1879786")
sb2$coordinate_modifier(Coordinates$EndIsExactOrWithin)
sb2$range_filters(strand == "-")

junction_union(sb1, sb2)
